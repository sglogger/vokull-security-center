# Changelog

All notable changes to Vokull Security Center are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

When a release goes out, the same summary must also be added to the
`== Changelog ==` section of `readme.txt` — that is what WordPress shows in the
plugin details modal.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- **The plugin is now called Vokull Security Center.** The WordPress.org plugin
  review flagged "Sentinel" as a name that is already carried by well-known
  security products — Microsoft Sentinel among them — in exactly this field, so
  a plugin opening with it invites the assumption that it is one of theirs. The
  project has been developed under the name *Vökull* — Icelandic for "vigilant",
  "watchful" — from the start, so the name it now ships under is the one it
  already had. The reserved permalink is `vokull-security-center`; the text
  domain and the main plugin file were renamed to match, as were the admin page
  slugs and the plugin icon assets.

  Nothing you have configured is lost. Option names, hook names, the database
  tables and the GeoIP directory under `uploads/` all keep their `wpsec` prefix
  and are untouched, so settings, the log, the file and user baselines and any
  downloaded GeoIP database survive the rename unchanged.

  **Upgrading an existing install needs one manual step**, for the same reason
  1.4.0 did: WordPress reactivates a plugin by the path it recorded, and that
  path — the old main file — no longer exists, so the plugin is left switched
  off. Activate Vokull Security Center on the Plugins screen and monitoring
  resumes with your existing settings and baselines. Until you do, nothing is
  being monitored. First-time installs are unaffected.

- **Everything the plugin says at runtime now calls itself "Security Center".**
  The admin menu already did; the activation and deactivation log entries, the
  alert e-mail footer, the multisite refusal and the two platform guards did
  not, and named the whole product where the short name reads better. The
  distributed name — the one on the Plugins screen and in the directory — is
  the full "Vokull Security Center".

- **The Description explains the name.** `("vökull" is Icelandic for
  "vigilant/watchful")` now travels with the plugin header and the readme,
  where a reader meets the word for the first time.

- **Cloudflare's address ranges are fetched on request, not on sight.** Opening
  Settings → Login & Location used to read `cloudflare.com/ips-v4` and `ips-v6`
  as a side effect of rendering the page, refreshing weekly. Nothing about the
  site was sent and the result was only ever a suggestion — but a settings
  screen must not send a request to a third party on the reader's behalf, and
  WordPress.org is right to call that phoning home. The tab now shows a "Fetch
  Cloudflare's address ranges" button and does nothing at all until it is
  pressed; the request lives in `Cloudflare_Ranges::refresh()`, which is
  reachable from that one action and from nowhere else. There is no scheduled
  task and no refresh-on-render: a stored list that has aged past a week says
  so and offers the button again, rather than acting on its own.

  Fetching still adds nothing to the trusted-proxy list. That remains a second,
  separate click, because every address in a trusted proxy range can dictate
  the client IP the login rules are applied to.

  On an existing install nothing is lost: the ranges already stored keep
  working and the preset is offered from them as before.

- **Two login errors are translatable again.** The message a refused login
  shows — for a country rule, and for API authentication against an account
  with two factors — was passed through `__()` with no text domain at all,
  which means WordPress looked it up in its own catalogue. The comment above it
  claimed the wording was byte-identical to what core says for a wrong
  password, and that turned out not to be true: core names the user and appends
  a "Lost your password?" link, and this exact sentence appears nowhere in
  WordPress. So the string was never going to be found in core's catalogue, and
  rendered in English in every locale while achieving none of the matching it
  was written for.

  It now carries this plugin's text domain like every other string, so it is
  translated through the same channel as the rest. The wording is unchanged and
  still names no reason for the refusal — which is the disclosure that actually
  matters — and the comments no longer claim a resemblance to core that is not
  there.

### Removed

- **The bundled translation catalogues.** `languages/` held a `.pot` and a
  complete German `.po`, compiled to `.mo` at release time. A plugin hosted on
  WordPress.org is translated at translate.wordpress.org instead, which
  generates a catalogue for every locale and delivers it through the ordinary
  update system — so a bundled copy only duplicates that, and goes stale
  against it. The strings are unchanged and still fully internationalised; the
  German translation returns through the standard channel. Both the local
  packaging script and the release workflow now refuse to put a `.po`, `.pot`
  or `.mo` into the ZIP at all, and the now-pointless `Domain Path` header is
  gone.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **An "External services" section in `readme.txt`.** The plugin can contact two
  services, and a reader had no way to know what either request carries. Both
  are now spelled out: the MaxMind download at
  `download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download`, which sends the licence key you
  configured and the edition name and is never called until you enter that key,
  and the plain reads of `cloudflare.com/ips-v4` and `ips-v6`, which send
  nothing beyond the request itself and are cached for a week. Neither is
  contacted from the front end or during a login, and nothing about the site,
  its users or its visitors is sent to either. Disclosure of external services
  is required for a plugin hosted on WordPress.org.

### Changed

- **The GeoIP downloader deletes its temporary files through
  `wp_delete_file()`.** The download, the staged extraction and the failure
  paths all called `@unlink()` directly. The behaviour is the same; the
  difference is that the deletions now pass through the filter WordPress
  provides for them. The atomic `rename()` of the staged database over the live
  one stays as it is, and now says why in place: a login resolving a country
  while the swap runs must see either the old file or the new one, and
  `WP_Filesystem::move()` neither guarantees that nor is initialised during
  cron, which is when this runs.

- **`load_plugin_textdomain()` is no longer called.** WordPress has loaded a
  translation just in time on the first `__()` for the domain since 4.6, and for
  a plugin hosted on WordPress.org the `.mo` files are delivered into
  `WP_LANG_DIR` and picked up from there. The explicit call did nothing but run
  earlier than it had to.

- **The code-standards exemptions moved out of the project ruleset and onto the
  statements they apply to.** `phpcs.xml.dist` is read by our own tooling and by
  nothing else — the Plugin Check plugin runs its own ruleset and never sees it,
  so a file-wide exemption there read as clean locally while the same code was
  still flagged on review. Every suppression that applies to a single statement
  is now an inline `phpcs:ignore`, or a `phpcs:disable`/`phpcs:enable` pair
  where the statement spans several lines, each carrying its justification at
  the point it applies to: the custom-table queries that interpolate a table
  name while binding every value, the CSV export writing to `php://output`, the
  direct filesystem access in the scanners and the GeoIP downloader — including
  the tail read of a database too large to load whole — the handful of silenced
  calls whose failure is ordinary and is answered by the return value that
  follows, `xmlrpc_enabled` as a core filter rather than a hook of ours, and the
  Cloudflare range URLs, which are data rather than offloaded assets. The fifty
  event descriptions in `Mailer::descriptions()` each carry their own
  `translators:` comment instead of one note on the method. Two of the old
  file-wide exemptions turned out to cover nothing at all once the statements
  were annotated, and are simply gone. Nothing about how the code behaves
  changed; the reasoning is now visible where it matters and the automated
  checks can see it too.

- **The translation files caught up with the last three releases.** The `.pot`
  had not been regenerated since 1.4.0, so it still offered translators three
  strings belonging to the removed GitHub updater and the removed automatic-
  update event, and offered them nothing at all for the two strings 1.6.5 added
  — "Pending update check" and "Plugin update available". Both are now
  translated in the German catalogue, which is complete again apart from the
  plugin name, the author name and the two URLs, which are deliberately left
  alone. The regenerated `.pot` also carries the fifty new `translators:`
  comments, which is the point of writing them.

- **Whitespace only: the option watchlist is aligned again.** Removing
  `auto_update_plugin` in 1.6.5 left the remaining keys padded to the width of a
  name that is no longer there.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **A plugin with an update waiting is now an event of its own.**
  `plugin.update_available` is raised once per available version by a new daily
  check, carrying the installed version, the version on offer, and whether the
  plugin is active. It starts at log only; set it to e-mail in Settings →
  Events on a site nobody reads the dashboard of, because an unpatched plugin
  is the most common way a WordPress site is taken over. The check only reads
  the update information WordPress collects on its own schedule — nothing here
  checks for, downloads or installs anything.

### Removed

- **The `option.auto_update_changed` event.** Watching the `auto_update_*`
  options made the plugin scanner read the plugin as taking part in updates,
  and the check was not worth the ambiguity. The Hardening screen still reports
  whether automatic updates are on, and `config.autoupdate_constant_changed`
  still catches `AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED` being set in `wp-config.php`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-18

### Removed

- **The GitHub Releases self-updater.** The `Update URI` header, the
  `pre_set_site_transient_update_plugins` / `site_transient_update_plugins` /
  `plugins_api` / `upgrader_source_selection` filters and the cached release
  lookup are gone, along with `includes/class-updater.php` and the
  `WPSEC_GITHUB_TOKEN` constant. A plugin hosted on wordpress.org may not
  install or serve updates from an external source; updates are distributed
  through wordpress.org.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **"Check again" reported no update for up to six hours after one was
  released.** The GitHub release lookup is cached for six hours to stay under
  the unauthenticated API rate limit, but `update-core.php?force-check=1` only
  clears the caches WordPress itself owns — it calls `wp_version_check()` and,
  via `load-update-core.php`, `wp_update_plugins()`, and never
  `wp_clean_update_cache()`. The forced check therefore replayed our own cached
  answer: the button truthfully said "no updates" while an update existed. A
  forced check now bypasses the cache and re-queries GitHub. It is gated on the
  `update_plugins` capability, because `force-check` is a query argument any
  visitor can set and an anonymous request coinciding with a scheduled refresh
  would otherwise spend one of the 60 API calls an hour.

### Added

- **The plugin now has its own icon in the WordPress update screens.** Every
  screen that pictures a plugin fell back to the generic puzzle piece:
  `update-core.php` walks `$update->icons` (svg, 2x, 1x, default) and otherwise
  prints `dashicons-admin-plugins`, and the details modal does the same with
  `$api->icons`. Both are now supplied, SVG first. The admin menu keeps its
  `dashicons-shield-alt`, which is deliberate — the menu icon is a silhouette
  in a strip of other silhouettes, and a colour logo reads as an advert there.

### Changed

- **The 1024px icon master is kept out of the release ZIP.** It is a source
  asset for store listings; nothing in the plugin references it, and at ~730 KB
  it weighed twice as much as the entire rest of the package. The SVG and the
  256px PNG — the two the updater points WordPress at — do ship.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **`composer.lock` was out of date with `composer.json`.** The 1.4.0 rename
  changed the package name in `composer.json`, and the package name is part of
  the content hash Composer records in the lock — so `composer validate
  --strict` failed the CI test job on every run since. The lock has been
  regenerated; only the hash changed, no dependency versions moved.

- **The release workflow ran a Node 20 action.** GitHub deprecated the Node 20
  Actions runtime, so `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` was being force-run on
  Node 24 with a warning on every release. Pinned to `v3`, whose only change
  from `v2.6.2` is that runtime bump; the inputs are identical.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **`Tested up to` in readme.txt carried a patch number.** The field is defined
  as a WordPress *major* version, so `7.0.4` is rejected by the plugin review
  checks rather than merely tidied up. It now reads `7.0`.

- **The release ZIP shipped `vendor/` without `composer.json`.** The packaging
  step deliberately excluded every tooling config from the plugin root, but
  `vendor/` is installed by Composer and does ship, and a Composer-built
  dependency tree with no manifest describing it is flagged by the review
  tooling. `composer.json` is now staged into the ZIP with the rest of the
  plugin; `composer.lock` and the remaining dev configs stay out.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **The plugin is now called Sentinel Security Center.** WordPress.org does not
  allow a plugin display name or permalink to begin with "wp", so the name, the
  slug and the text domain all had to change: `wp-security-center` became
  `sentinel-security-center`, and the main plugin file was renamed to match. The
  GitHub repository moved to `sglogger/sentinel-security-center`; the old URLs
  redirect, and the updater now queries the new one.

  Nothing you have configured is lost. Option names, hook names, the database
  tables and the GeoIP directory under `uploads/` all keep their `wpsec` prefix
  and are untouched, so your settings, the log, the file and user baselines and
  any downloaded GeoIP database survive the upgrade unchanged.

  **This upgrade needs one manual step.** WordPress deactivates a plugin before
  updating it and reactivates it afterwards by the path it recorded — and that
  path, the old main file, no longer exists. The reactivation therefore fails
  and the plugin is left switched off. Open the Plugins screen and activate
  Sentinel Security Center by hand; monitoring resumes with your existing
  settings and baselines, and no further action is needed. Until you do,
  nothing is being monitored. Sites installing the plugin for the first time
  are unaffected.

  Upgraded sites keep the old `wp-security-center` directory name, because the
  updater installs into the directory the plugin already occupies. That is
  cosmetic: every path in the plugin is derived from its own location. To tidy
  it up, deactivate, delete and install the new ZIP — settings and log survive,
  as they live in the database.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-18

### Security

- **Two-factor authentication could be bypassed entirely through xmlrpc.php.**
  The challenge hangs off `wp_login`, which only `wp_signon()` fires — but
  XML-RPC calls `wp_authenticate()` directly, so a stolen password typed into
  xmlrpc.php walked straight past the second factor it was set up to survive.
  Primary-password API authentication is now refused for any account with a
  second factor (event: `2fa.api_auth_refused`, wearing the ordinary
  wrong-password message so the endpoint does not reveal which accounts have
  2FA). Application passwords are unaffected — they are the documented,
  revocable credential for integrations.

- **The GitHub token could leak to an arbitrary host.** The updater attaches
  its token on the `http_request_args` filter, which sees every HTTP request
  WordPress makes, and matched its own asset URL by substring — so any request
  to a URL merely *containing* `api.github.com/repos/…/releases/assets/`
  (for example in a query string) got the `Authorization` header attached and
  sent to whatever host it was really for. The URL is now parsed and matched
  structurally: HTTPS, host exactly `api.github.com`, path prefix exact.

- **CSV export was a formula-injection carrier.** The log records hostile input
  by design — a user name typed into the login form, a request path, a user
  agent — and Excel executes exported cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@`
  as formulas. Text cells with such a first character are now prefixed with a
  quote, which spreadsheets render as plain text.

- **The two-factor attempt limit is now also enforced per user**, not only per
  user-and-address (25 vs 10 per 15 minutes). Rotating addresses no longer
  multiplies the guess budget for a six-digit code by the size of the botnet.

### Added

- **IP deny list.** A list of addresses and CIDR blocks — IPv4 and IPv6 — that
  can never sign in, on the *Login & Location* settings tab beside the allow
  list. It is the strongest rule in the decision table and sits ahead of every
  other rail: it overrides the allow list, an allowed country, and the
  private-network exemption, and it applies whether or not country checking is
  switched on, because typing an address into it is an instruction in its own
  right. Only the `WPSEC_DISABLE_BLOCKING` constant stands it down — the escape
  hatch exists for exactly the case where this list is what locked the
  administrator out.

  Two deliberate refusals. A denied address gets **no bypass link**: that token
  exists to rescue someone a country rule caught by accident, and mailing a way
  around an explicit deny would undo the instruction. And the settings screen
  **refuses to store an entry matching the address you are saving from**,
  reporting which entries it dropped — otherwise the setting would save, the
  current session would survive, and the door would shut at the next login.

  The check runs after the password is verified, so a `login.blocked_denylist`
  entry means someone at that address had working credentials — high signal,
  and worth reading as such. The event defaults to **Info level action: log
  only**, configurable per event like every other, because a deny list doing its
  job on a hostile address is a working control rather than an incident.

  This blocks the login, not the traffic. Refusing the address at the firewall
  or CDN is still cheaper and still the right place for volume.

### Changed

- **The log search box now covers every column the log shows.** It searched the
  description, the object and the user; it now also searches the event type, the
  IP address and the timestamp. Time is both stored and displayed as UTC in the
  same format, so `2026-08-18`, `14:32` or `08-18 14` match what is on screen
  with no timezone arithmetic in between — which is the point, since a search
  box that cannot find a row you are looking straight at is worse than none.

- **readme.txt now declares WordPress 7.0.4** rather than 6.9 under *Tested up
  to*, so the details modal stops reporting the plugin as untested on a current
  install. Note that this value is compared with `version_compare`, so it has to
  be the full `7.0.4` — `7.0` would still read as untested against 7.0.4.

### Fixed

- **The plugins screen went on offering an update that was already installed.**
  WordPress checks for updates about twice a day and reads the cached answer in
  between, and only an update applied *through the updater* clears that cache.
  Update the files any other way — git pull, rsync, an unzipped upload — and the
  screen keeps saying "version 1.2.0 is available" for hours after 1.2.0 is
  running. Two changes: the cached transient is now corrected on read, so an
  offer of a version at or below the installed one is moved to "up to date"
  immediately; and the plugin notices when its own version on disk has changed
  since the last request and throws away both cached checks. A genuinely newer
  release is untouched.

- **The details modal showed the changelog of the version you already had.** The
  bundled readme.txt was preferred over the release notes unconditionally, so
  "View version 1.2.0 details" answered with 1.1.1's changelog — the one thing
  the reader is certainly not asking about. The notes for the offered release
  now go on top, with the bundled history underneath, and the version shown is
  the newer of the release and the installed copy instead of always the release
  (a development checkout ahead of the last tag used to describe itself with an
  older version number).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Hardening screen.** A read-only report on what this installation currently
  looks like to someone trying to get into it: 22 checks across code execution,
  wp-config and file permissions, staying current, accounts and access, and
  monitoring. Each one states what is true right now, what to change and where,
  and links to the section of the official
  [WordPress hardening guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/hardening/)
  it comes from, so the advice can be checked against the source instead of
  taken on trust.

  Verdicts are Good, Fix this, Worth fixing — and *Your call*, which is not a
  failing grade. `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` is the case that made the fourth verdict
  necessary: it closes the "install a plugin that is really a shell" path
  outright, and it also blocks every security update, so a site with it set and
  no deployment pipeline behind it gets steadily less safe rather than more.
  Grading that pass or fail would be dishonest, so the trade-off is spelled out
  instead. The same applies to moving wp-config.php, to the table prefix, and to
  renaming the "admin" account — all three are cases where the guide itself is
  lukewarm, and the screen says so.

  The page also lists what it deliberately cannot grade — the host's patching,
  the machine you administer from, FTP versus SFTP, database user privileges —
  with links into the guide for each.

- **Two-factor authentication (TOTP).** A one-time code from any authenticator
  app, asked for after the password is accepted; the session is issued only once
  that code is right. Enrolment is per account and voluntary by default, with a
  site setting to require it for everyone who can `manage_options` after a grace
  period that starts when the requirement is switched on.

  - The secret is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from
    `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, so a database dump without `wp-config.php` cannot mint
    codes.
  - Each code is accepted once. The last accepted time step is recorded, which
    closes the replay window a 30-second code would otherwise leave open.
  - The QR code is rendered locally as inline SVG — sending the provisioning URI
    to an external QR service would hand the shared secret to a third party.
  - Nothing is switched on until a code from the app has been accepted, so a
    mistyped setup key cannot lock anyone out.
  - Application passwords, REST and XML-RPC are not challenged, by design.

  **Recovery**, for the day the authenticator is gone: ten single-use recovery
  codes issued at enrolment and shown once; optionally a one-time code mailed to
  the account address, off by default because it reduces the second factor to
  whoever reads that mailbox; and as a last resort a reset by another
  administrator from the user's profile screen. Recovery codes are stored as
  hashes rather than encrypted, so they keep working after a salt rotation —
  which is exactly when the TOTP secrets stop decrypting.

  Eleven new event types under a *Two-factor authentication* heading in the
  alert matrix. Enrolment and passed challenges are Info; a wrong code after a
  correct password is a Warning, because whoever submitted it has working
  credentials; switching the factor off, using a recovery code, using the
  e-mail fallback and changing the policy all e-mail immediately.

  Adds one runtime dependency, `bacon/bacon-qr-code`, for the QR rendering.

- **Failed login attempts are now recorded** as `login.failed`, and appear in
  the alert matrix under Logins like every other event. The default is
  deliberately Info / log only: on a public site bots guess passwords around the
  clock, and mailing that out is how an inbox learns to ignore this plugin. The
  row carries the submitted user name, the IP and its country, the reason core
  gave (`invalid_username`, `incorrect_password`, …) and whether the account
  actually exists — so a spray across many names and a hammering of one account
  are distinguishable in the log. Still no counters, thresholds or lockouts:
  nothing is enforced on a failed attempt.

  A login refused by the country rule is not counted twice — it is already
  recorded as `login.blocked_geo`.

### Fixed

- **The scanner reported its own files.** `Geoip_Database::refresh()` read the
  state option before `directory()` created the GeoIP directory, then wrote the
  stale copy back — erasing the recorded path. The file scanner uses that path
  to recognise its own guard files, so from the first database refresh onward it
  reported `wpsec-geoip-*/index.php` and `wpsec-geoip-*/.htaccess` as a critical
  find. The exemption no longer depends on the option at all: a file is skipped
  only when it sits in a `wpsec-geoip-*` directory under uploads, carries one of
  our guard file names, and matches our bytes exactly — so a shell dropped in
  beside them, or written over them, is still reported.

- **A `.htaccess` in uploads was reported as an executable file.** It was walked
  with the PHP files and inherited their event and wording ("An executable file
  appeared … should never contain PHP"), which is wrong on both counts. It is
  now a separate scope with its own message and the `file.uploads_htaccess_changed`
  event — which the registry and the mailer already defined but nothing emitted.

- **Localised installs reported `wp-includes/version.php` as modified, forever.**
  Only `get_locale()` was consulted, so a site whose core package and current
  language differ was checked against a manifest that describes a different
  build. The lookup now prefers `$wp_local_package`, and accepts a manifest only
  once its `version.php` matches the file on disk.

- **"View details" disappeared whenever GitHub could not be reached.** The
  updater returned early on a failed release lookup, leaving the plugin out of
  the `update_plugins` transient — and WordPress renders that link only for
  plugins it finds there. It now always registers, falling back to the version
  and readme data on disk. The modal also stops offering a WordPress.org plugin
  page that does not exist, and orders its tabs Description → Installation → FAQ
  → Changelog.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Updating from a **private** GitHub repository failed at the download step,
  after the update had already been advertised — the worst possible order. The
  release asset was fetched from its `browser_download_url`, which cannot carry
  credentials; a private repository requires the API asset URL together with the
  token and `Accept: application/octet-stream`. Public repositories were never
  affected.

  Because the fix lives in the updater itself, an install already running 1.1.0
  against a private repository has to be updated to 1.1.1 by hand once. From
  1.1.1 onward it updates itself.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-18

The first release that does anything. 1.0.0 was scaffolding.

### Added

- **Event log.** Custom table with a `WP_List_Table` viewer: sorting, paging,
  search, filters by category, severity, timeframe and IP, and a CSV export that
  carries exactly the filters on screen.
- **Plugin and theme monitoring** — install, activate, deactivate, update,
  delete, auto-update, plus plugins that appear on disk with no install recorded
  (an SFTP drop).
- **User and administrator monitoring** — creation, deletion, role changes,
  promotion to and demotion from administrator, e-mail and password changes,
  application passwords, and the case that matters most after a session
  takeover: an administrator changing their own account.
- **Out-of-band change detection.** An hourly reconciliation compares the users
  table against a stored baseline of row hashes. This is the only way to see a
  changed login name, because WordPress offers no code path that produces one.
- **Configuration monitoring** — critical options with old and new values,
  `wp-config.php` and `.htaccess` hashes, WordPress core files against the
  official checksums, cron jobs, new must-use plugins, XML-RPC and file-editor
  state.
- **File integrity** for `wp-content/mu-plugins` and any PHP file under uploads,
  with weighted backdoor-signature heuristics. Scanned files are opened
  read-only and are never modified, quarantined or deleted.
- **Geo-aware login control.** Country from a trusted CDN header or a local
  MaxMind GeoLite2 database, never an external API call during login. Monitor
  mode by default; optional blocking with four independent recovery paths.
- **Immediate e-mail alerts**, configurable per event type as e-mail, log only,
  or off, with an hourly circuit breaker so a mass finding cannot flood a mail
  server. A test-alert button proves delivery works.
- **Diagnostics screen** showing how the site resolved your address and why,
  plus a what-if test for any other address.
- **Status screen** covering login protection, the GeoIP database (including a
  live check that it is not reachable over the web), alert budget and scheduled
  scans.
- **Complete German translation** of the interface and the alert e-mails.
- Unit tests for the WordPress-free security logic: CIDR matching, proxy-aware
  IP resolution, the access decision table, and the backdoor heuristics.

### Fixed

- `preg_replace` with the removed `/e` modifier was never detected: the rule
  looked for the modifier after the PHP string's closing quote instead of inside
  the pattern, where it actually lives.
- The GeoIP health check reported "healthy" whenever trusted proxies and a
  country header name were merely configured, without either a database or an
  actual header. Under the fail-closed rule that kept blocking armed with no way
  to resolve anything, which would have locked out every user. It now requires a
  header to actually be present on the request.
- A phantom "role changed" and "password changed" event fired for every newly
  created user, because both signals arrive before `user_register`.
- A promotion to administrator was reported as an ordinary role change with the
  wrong previous roles, because `WP_User::set_role()` fires `remove_user_role`
  first and the buffered roles were already partly rewritten.
- Activating a plugin also produced a false "the active plugin list was written
  directly" alert, because the marker distinguishing a legitimate activation was
  set after the option had already been written.
- The uploads scanner alarmed about the plugin's own GeoIP directory, which
  lives under uploads and contains an `index.php`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-17

Initial scaffolding: plugin bootstrap, installer, database schema, admin menu,
GitHub Releases self-updater, CI and the local development environment.

### Fixed

- Updater: a failed GitHub lookup cached an empty array that was then read back
  as though it were a valid release, producing a fatal error on the Plugins
  screen. Affects any repository without a published release.
